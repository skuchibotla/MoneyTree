# Money Tree

* Money Tree is a budgeting application that divides a user's income using the 50/30/20 budget rule and helps a user keep track of their expenses to stay within the suggested amount
* Technology stack: React.js, Express.js (framework of Node.js), and MySQL
* Integrates Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node, to consume REST APIs made to the MySQL database

> 50/30/20 budget rule is a suggested budget of spending 50% of your income on necessities, 30% on desires, and 20% in savings.
